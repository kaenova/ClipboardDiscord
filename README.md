Go to `config.json` and configure your prefix and discord bot token, you can also change the command for clipping and deleting from a clipboard.

## Usage
The commands are (with prefix `*`):
### Clipping
```
*clip [name of clipboard] [message_id]
```
### Deleting
```
*del [name of clipboard]
```
### Calling a Clipboard
```

## Future Development and Notes
Because currently only work with "1 bot = 1 server", maybe in the future will implement so can work to many server with one bot. Will adding some function to show all the clipboard_key.
